People decide to go to law school without being fully-informed. The goal of this website is not to discourage you from attending law school. The goal is to inform you about being a lawyer, so you can make the decision that is best for you. I wish someone had told me these things before I went to law school. Here are the top ten reasons not to go to law school. If you have better reasons to go, then go for it!

If it's too late and you're in law school or a lawyer, it isn't too late to change your mind! Lawyers can transfer out! They learn lots of useful skills from being a lawyer: organization, attention to detail, management, advocacy, sales, research, writing, problem solving, among many other things.

<br />

If you (1) want to be a lawyer, (2) have a clear understanding of what kind of law you want to practice, (3) have a clear understanding of what the experiences is in that practice, (4) are pretty sure you can get a job practicing that kind of law, and (5) understand what it means to be a lawyer (see left side of page), then GO FOR IT!
